Scripts In is a Social-Fi protocol for creators to build their community and sell exclusive content through NFTs. By combining on-chain and decentralized storages, users would buy NFTs from creators to gain access to the content.

The protocol also rewards both users and creators based on their platform activities with SCRIPTS Points. The system would encourage users to actively interact within the community to gain more SCRIPTS points.
